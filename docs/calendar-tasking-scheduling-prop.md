# Calendar / Tasking Scheduling Proposal

<<<<<<< HEAD

## overview

Used to track / manage items that need to be completed and remind the user to complete them.

## Task items

- Add task CRUD API options
- A task will have:

  - title
  - desc / details
  - date added
  - due date
  - tags(?)
  - complete (user settable options for delete / archive)
  - sub tasks
  - _more advanced options:_
    - repeat (this will take more thinking a specifics planning)
    - importance / color options **?**
    - note ID (can tie notes to a task)

- Task Behavior:

  - Any incomplete tasks will carry over until complete
  - create task group's this would expand / collapses when taped in the task view

- Views:
  - daily
  - weekly
  - monthly
