# Calendar / Tasking Scheduling Proposal

## overview

Used to track / manage items that need to be completed and remind the user to complete them.

## Task items

- Add task CRUD API options
- A task will have:
    - title
    - desc / details
    - date added
    - due date
    - tags(?)
    - complete (user settable options for delete / archive)
    - sub tasks
    - _more advanced options:_
        - repeat (this will take more thinking a specifics planning)
        - importance / color options **?**
        - note ID (can tie notes to a task)

- Task Behavior:
    - Any incomplete tasks will carry over until complete
    - create task group's this would expand / collapses when taped in the task view

- Views:
    - daily
    - weekly
    - monthly
